# Classification of Cyber ​​Threats: NLP approach on MITER ATT&CK

Our end-of-year project aims to develop a methodology for classifying cyber threats using the NLP (Natural Language Processing) approach of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. By combining machine learning algorithms and transformers, the goal is to create a system capable of efficiently analyzing and categorizing various cyber threats. This approach will enable a better understanding of potential attacks, as well as a faster and more precise identification of security measures to implement.
